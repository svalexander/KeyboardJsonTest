I had trouble at first with returning the Json, I kept getting an empty array and then added serializable to my KeyResponse pojo to be able to get the array of keys.
The other thing I had trouble with was the url for the image, I realized I had added a space at the beginning and was also getting two "/". Removed them and got the image.
